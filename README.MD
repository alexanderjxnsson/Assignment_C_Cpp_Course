Project type:   Final assignment

In the beginning of the program we launch the checkFile function.
If the file is ok, we continue into the programs main menu.
If the file failes, we end the program.

While in the main menu we got a few options.
Either we can start the game, if so we launch the theGame functon.
Or we can display the highscore list by entering the showHighscoreList functin.
Or we can enter the admin mode, by enter the adminMenu function, but we need a password for that.
The last option in the main menu is exiting the program, and yes, it it exits the program.
